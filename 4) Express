Express:
It is a npm package.
It is a framework.
Manages everything from receiving a request and sending the response.

Framework:
Provides a flow for the user/coder for software development.
It provides a foundation/template where the coder can add their code.

Working with express:

const express = require("express");
->get the package from npm
->the package returns a function

const app = express();
->express() will give all the functionalities of express
->use app variable to make express application
->use this app to make routes

app.get("/home", function (req,res){
res.send("Welcome Home");
});
->app.get(route, requestHandler);
->route is the url after the domain
->request handler is a middleware

app.listen(3000);
->app.listen(PORT);
->run the server on the PORT

Nodemon:
npm install -g
-> -g is global, no need to install again and again

Middlewares:
website->middleware->route->response
->performs some task before reaching the requestHandler

app.use(function(req,res,next){
//do some work
next();
});
->put this before the routr
->runs the app.use() for any request before reaching the route
->next() forwards the request
->you can put multiple middlewares before the routes and every middleware will execute
