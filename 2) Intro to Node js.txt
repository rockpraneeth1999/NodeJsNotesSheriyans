Node js is not a programming language, framework , library.
Node js is a run time environment.

Before Node js came into picture:
Js cannot be used to make backend because it doesn't have the functionality to make backend applications.

Ryan Dahl want to make backend apps using js.
Google chrome has a V8 engine, which is open source, used to run js.
V8 engine is coded in C++.

Ryan Dahl made a wrapper around V8 which is in js, you write a code in js which is received by the wrapper layer then the C++ modules makes a serve with the code.

That wrapper layer + V8 engine = Node JS.




Install Node js:
Download Node js LTS(Long Term Support)
open CMD
	node -v
	npm -v

NPM - Node Package Manager, is like a package store which has all open source packages.

Working with Node js:
npm init (initialize a node js project)
npm init -y (no questions asked)

npm init creates a package.json file, which contains everything about that node js application.

Node provides a bunch of modules, you use those modules to code.
const your_variable = require("module_name")
require modules of callback and async not promisified from docs
run the file with node
	node file_name.js
